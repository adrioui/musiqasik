## 2024-05-23 - Debounce Resize Listener **Learning:** Window resize events fire extremely frequently (often once per frame) during a drag. Binding expensive calculations (like D3 graph dimension updates) directly to the resize event causes significant layout thrashing and jank. **Action:** Always wrap expensive resize handlers in a `debounce` function (e.g., 200ms delay). Ensure the debounced function's `.cancel()` method is called in the `useEffect` cleanup to prevent race conditions or updates on unmounted components.
